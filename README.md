## Data Overview
Includes 2 tables of data, a country dataset with 250 records of countries serviced by british airways, another dataset with over 1,000 record of british airways customer reviews from 2016 to 2023, with fields such as customer's overall rating, and customer's ratings based on "seat comfort", "cabing staff services", "food beverages", "ground services", "value for money" and "entertainment"

## Creating Dashboard
Both tables were merged on "country", new parameter created to highlight all Key metrics and a calculated field to easily aggregate and chart key metrics. Aircrafts with less than 50 review counts were grouped as "various" (for significant visual). The key performance indicators are visibly displayed on dashboard to easily view overall British Airways performance based on customer reviews.The filters or visuals can be used interactively to view specific information on the dashboard.
